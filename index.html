Creating a prompt for an AI that can generate a high-converting website in HTML and CSS requires specific, structured instructions. The key is to break down the website into its core components and specify exactly what each section should do and look like.

Here is a prompt designed for an AI like Bolt AI to code a high-converting HVAC website. This prompt provides a detailed breakdown of the site's structure, content, and design.

**Prompt for Bolt AI: High-Converting HVAC Website**

Generate a complete, single-page website in HTML and pure CSS for a high-converting HVAC company. The website must be professional, clean, mobile-responsive, and designed to address the primary pain points of HVAC customers. The color palette should be trustworthy and modern, primarily using shades of blue, gray, and white.

### **1. Website Structure and Header**

* **HTML & CSS:** The code must be a single `index.html` file with embedded CSS within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`. Do not use external stylesheets.
* **Header:** Create a fixed header that stays at the top of the page as the user scrolls.
    * **Left Side:** Place a container for the company logo. Use a placeholder image with the text "Company Logo."
    * **Right Side:** Include the main contact information. This should feature a prominent, clickable phone number for immediate service and a clear **"Schedule Service"** button. The button should have a hover effect.

### **2. Hero Section**

* **Visuals:** A full-width, high-quality banner image of a friendly, professional technician.

* **Call-to-Action (CTA):** A prominent button in the center of the section with the text **"Get a Free Quote."** This button should have a strong hover effect to grab attention.

### **3. Pain Points & Solutions Section**

* **Heading:** "We Solve Your Biggest HVAC Headaches."
* **Content:** Create a grid of four visually distinct cards or boxes. Each card should feature a simple icon (you can use emojis or a CSS icon equivalent) and a headline that directly addresses a customer pain point. Below the headline, include a short, reassuring sentence.
    1.  **Uncertainty about Cost:**
        * **Icon:** üí∞
        * **Headline:** Upfront Pricing
        * **Text:** "Know the full cost before we start. No hidden fees or surprises."
    2.  **Emergency Situations:**

    3.  **Trust and Expertise:**
        * **Icon:** üõ†Ô∏è
        * **Headline:** Licensed & Certified Technicians
        * **Text:** "Our team is fully vetted and trained for your peace of mind."
    4.  **Inconvenience & Disruption:**

        * **Headline:** Clean & Tidy Service
        * **Text:** "We respect your home and always leave our workspace spotless."

### **4. Services Section**

* **Content:** Display a list of services offered. Use cards with a service name, a brief description, and a **"Learn More"** button for each.
    * **Services to Include:** AC Repair & Maintenance, Furnace Installation, and Indoor Air Quality Solutions.
    * **Visuals:** Use a placeholder image for each service card.

### **5. Trust & Testimonials Section**

* **Heading:** "What Our Customers Are Saying."
* **Content:** A container showcasing two to three customer testimonials. Each testimonial should include a quote, the customer's name, and their location.
* **Social Proof:** Below the testimonials, include a row of placeholder logos for certifications or affiliations (e.g., BBB, NATE Certified, etc.) to build trust.

### **6. Footer**

* **Content:** A professional footer with the company logo on the left. On the right, include the company's full contact information (address, phone number, and email). Add social media icons that link to the company's social pages. Include a copyright notice at the bottom.
